    "PageRank was the website sorting algorithm that cemented Google's early success in the 1990s, when it displayed webpages with the highest PageRank first. Its main idea is that important webpages are likely to receive many links from other important webpages. The PageRank algorithm can be seen as computing the probability that a person who randomly clicks on links and follows them will arrive at a particular website. PageRank includes a dampening factor that represents the probability that a person will actually keep clicking as opposed to stopping where they are. Itâ€™s usually set to 0.85.\n",

    "Incoming links lift a website's rank if they come from higher-ranked sites, particularly if these sites have few outgoing links. "
